# CULT Wallet Reputation Microservice

To ensure there is no ground for scammers the wallet reputation microservice might be helpful. 

The idea is that wallets who have already proved a certain level of trustworthyness can endorse other wallets which did amazing things.  

Having such a reputation system in place can speed up certain tasks e.g. the voting process executed by cultmanders.

First Drafts & Idea Collection

## Frontend
When it comes to state of the art web programming frameworks [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) is the framework [of choice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rv3Yq-B8qp4) imo.    
The two main reasons for that choice - comparing svelte to angular, vue and react - are performance and simplicity.   
You might continuously improve the performance of this page utilizing [pagespeed.web.dev](https://pagespeed.web.dev/).   
To speed up programming while ensuring beauty we might utilize the [UI Kit Attractions](https://illright.github.io/attractions/?ref=madewithsvelte.com) - see also [intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkD88ARvucM&t=492s).

If you use VS Code as IDE you might want to install the extension named "svelte for vs code".  

## Backend
When it comes to off-chain backends [Deno](https://deno.land) is the runtime environment of choice imo.    
Deno can be perceived as the successor of NodeJS imo.  
You might check the [Deno Main Repo](https://github.com/denoland/deno) and join the [Deno Community](https://discord.com/invite/deno).
